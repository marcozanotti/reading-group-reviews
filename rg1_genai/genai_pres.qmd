# 1. The TSF Problem

##

Time series forecasting (TSF) is the task of predicting future values of a 
given sequence based on previously observed values.  

![](img/ts_for.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}


## 

The TSF problem may be essentially identified by the following aspects:  

- **Prediction objective**: $\text{\underline{point forecasting}}$ vs probabilistic forecasting  

- **Forecast horizon**: short-term vs $\text{\underline{long-term}}$ forecasting  

- **Input-Output dimension**: $\text{\underline{univariate}}$ vs multivariate forecasting  

- **Forecasting task**: $\text{\underline{single-step}}$ vs $\text{\underline{multi-step}}$ forecasting  

The TSF problem is usually faced with statistical models (ARIMA, ETS) or 
deep learning models (RNN, LSTM).  


##

The main challenges of the TSF problem are:  

- **uncertainty** increases as the forecast horizon increases  

- difficulty in capturing **multiple complex patterns** over time  

- difficulty in capturing **long-term dependencies** (critical for long-term forecasting)  

- difficulty to handle **long input sequences**    



# 2. Vanilla Transformer

- Based on Encoder-Decoder architecture  
- Uses self-attention mechanism to access any part of the sequence history  
- Positional encoding allows to account for element positions  
- Residual connections and layer normalization help to stabilize the learning 
process  
- Each encoder and decoder layer is composed of a self-attention layer and a

## Can vanilla Transformers be used for TSF?

The TSF problem can be seen as a sequence learning problem such as machine 
translation. 
    
Main ingredients allowing to use vanilla Transformers for TSF:  

- **Multi-head Self-attention** mechanism allows to access any part of the 
sequence history, capturing both short-term and long-term dependencies 
(but it is invariant to the order of elements in a sequence)  

- **Positional encoding** allows to account for the sequence ordering  

- **Masked self-attention** allows to avoid information leakage from future  


## Can vanilla Transformers be used for TSF?

Just few changes are needed to adapt Transformers to TSF:  

- **Remove the final activation** function (softmax) from the output layer and set 
the dimension of the linear layer equal to the forecasting horizon  

- **Adapt the structure** to the desired forecasting task (single-step or multi-step)

## Problems with vanilla Transformers

<!-- - **Locally agnostic**: the attention mechanism matches queries and keys without  -->
<!-- considering their local context being prone to temporal anomalies   -->

- **Positional encoding**: only the order in which two elements occur is taken 
into account, but their temporal distance is not  

- **Computational complexity**: given a sequence of length $L$, the time and 
memory burden is $O(L^2)$, making it difficult to learn patterns in long time 
series  

- **Simple Architecture**: the architecture does not include any component
of typical importance in TSF (e.g. autocorrelation, decomposition, 
recurrent layers, etc.)



# 3. TSF Transformers

## 

Transformers are **very appealing for long-term TSF** due to their ability to 
learn long-range dependencies. 

Many solutions have been proposed to adapt Transformers to TSF, mainly in the 
direction to <!-- improve the encoding, --> adopt more efficient attention and expand
the architecture.

## Informer

**Informer** employs two major improvements:  

- **ProbSparse Attention Mechanism**, which replaces the standard 
self-attention used in the vanilla transformer with a sparse attention so to 
achieve $O(LlogL)$ complexity  

- **Distilling Module**, which reduces the input size between encoder layers
into its half slice, removing redundancy and reducing the computational burden  


## Informer - Architecture

![](img/informer_arch.png){fig-align="center" height="250"}


## Informer - ProbSparse Attention

The main idea of **ProbSparse** is that just a small subset of queries ("active")
effectively contribute to the attention mechanism. The ProbSparse attention 
selects the "active" queries, and creates a reduced query matrix, which is then 
used to calculate the attention weights, reaching $O(LlogL)$ complexity.  

![](img/informer_attention.png){fig-align="center"}

In practice, the KL divergence is used to define a sparsity measure, 
since active queries distribution diverges from uniform, and a random sample of
$K$ is used to obtain a sparse matrix of keys.    


## Informer - Convolution Layers

Because of the ProbSparse self-attention, the encoder’s feature map has some 
redundancy that can be removed. The **distilling** operation is used to reduce 
the input size between encoder layers.  

In practice, Informer's distilling operation just adds **1D convolution layers**, 
along the time dimension, with max pooling between each of the encoder layers.  
$$X_{n+1} = MaxPool( \, ELU( \,Conv1d(Xn) \,) \,)$$

This reduces by half the size of the data between the feature space, improving
both memory and computational efficiency.

## Autoformer

**Autoformer** builds upon two traditional time series analysis methods:  

- **Decomposition Layer**, which allows to decompose the time series into 
seasonality and trend-cycle components, enhancing the model's ability to 
capture these components accurately  

- **Autocorrelation Attention Mechanism**, which replaces the standard 
self-attention used in the vanilla transformer with an autocorrelation 
mechanism, allowing to capture the temporal dependencies in the frequency
domain and achieving $O(LlogL)$ complexity   


## Autoformer - Architecture

![](img/autoformer_arch.png){fig-align="center"}


## Autoformer - Decomposition Layer

Autoformer incorporates **decomposition blocks** as an inner operation of the model.  

Encoder and decoder use decomposition blocks to extract and aggregate the 
trend-cyclical and seasonal components from the series progressively, so to make
raw data easier to predict.

For an input series $X_t$ with length $L$, the decomposition layer returns 
$X_{trend}$ and $X_{seasonal}$, both of length $L$. In practice, $X_{trend}$ 
is extracted using some form of moving-average and $X_{seasonal}$ is then 
obtained by difference.  


## Autoformer - Autocorrelation Attention

Autoformer uses **autocorrelation within the self-attention** layer, extracting
frequency-based dependencies from $(Q,K)$. The autocorrelation block measures the 
**time-delay similarity** and aggregates the top $n$ similar sub-series to 
reduce complexity.

![](img/autoformer_attention.png){fig-align="center"}

In practice, autocorrelation of the queries and keys for all lags is calculated 
at once by Fast Fourier Transform, so to achieve $O(LlogL)$ time complexity 
(similar to Informer).

# Appendix

## Autocorrelation

In theory, given a time lag $\tau$, **autocorrelation** for a single discrete variable 
$Y$ is used to measure the "relationship" between the variable at time $t$ to 
its past value at time $t - \tau$.  
$$Autocorrelation(\tau) = \mathcal{R}(\tau) = Corr(Y_t, Y_{t-\tau})$$

## Time Series Decomposition

In time series analysis, **decomposition** is a method of breaking down a time 
series into three systematic components: **trend-cycle**, 
**seasonal variations**, and **random fluctuations**.

## Time2Vec Embedding

**Time2Vec** is a method of encoding time information into a vector and has three 
important properties: 

1. **Periodicity**, captures periodic and non-periodic patterns
2. **Invariant to time rescaling**
3. **Model-agnostic**, can be combined with many models  

For a given scalar time $τ$, $t2v$ of $τ$ is defined as:  

$$t2v(\tau)[i] = \begin{cases} \omega_i \tau + \phi_i, & \mbox{if } i = 0 \\ \mathcal{F}(\omega_i \tau + \phi_i), & \mbox{if }1 \leq i \leq k \end{cases}$$

where $\mathcal{F}$ is a periodic activation function, and $\omega_i$ and $\phi_i$ are 
learnable parameters.  


## Informer - ProbSparse Attention

$$Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(\frac{Q_{reduced}K^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})V$$
$$M(q_i ,K) = \max_j \frac{q_iK_j^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} - \frac{1}{L_k} \sum_{j=1}^{L_k} \frac{q_iK_j^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}$$

## Autoformer - Autocorrelation Attention

$$\tau_1,..., \tau_k = arg \;Top-k \;(\mathcal{R}_{Q,K}(\tau))$$
$$Attention(Q,K,V) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} Roll(V,\tau_i) \times softmax(\mathcal{R}_{Q,K}(\tau_i))$$

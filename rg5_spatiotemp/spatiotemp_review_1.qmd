<!-- Samples from a Gaussian random process can be simulated using the function grf  -->
<!-- of the R library geoR or using the library Fields (search the web to explore  -->
<!-- other R-functions).  -->
<!-- Alternately you can implement your own code to simulate the data using the  -->
<!-- Cholesky decomposition (chol and rnorm functions in the base R package).  -->
<!-- In any case, briefly describe the method that you used to simulate your data  -->
<!-- in your paper. -->

<!-- Assess the impact of outliers on least squares estimates of the variogram model  -->
<!-- parameters using a short simulation study. Compare the LS estimates based on  -->
<!-- the empirical variogram with those obtained using the robust variograms proposed  -->
<!-- by Cressie and Hawkins (1980) (see Cressieâ€™s book page 69 and page 75 equations  -->
<!-- 2.4.12 and 2.4.13). -->

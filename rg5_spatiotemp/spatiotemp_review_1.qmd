<!-- # The empirical semivariogram is created by averaging the squared differences  -->
<!-- # between pairs of points that are approximately the same distance apart.   -->
<!-- # Even a few outliers can heavily influence this average (particularly because  -->
<!-- # you're squaring the difference).  -->
<!-- #  -->
<!-- # Outliers are almost always problematic for kriging, but they're particularly  -->
<!-- # bad when the outliers are scattered randomly throughout the study region  -->
<!-- # (rather than being clustered together).  This is because randomly scattered  -->
<!-- # outliers will affect the empirical semivariances at small distances (because  -->
<!-- # they might be right next to low values), but if the outliers are clustered,  -->
<!-- # the squared difference between two outliers might still be small, allowing for  -->
<!-- # accurate semivariogram estimation at small distances (which is the most  -->
<!-- # important part of the semivariogram because closer neighbors get the highest weights). -->

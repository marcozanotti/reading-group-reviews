<!-- Samples from a Gaussian random process can be simulated using the function grf  -->
<!-- of the R library geoR or using the library Fields (search the web to explore  -->
<!-- other R-functions).  -->
<!-- Alternately you can implement your own code to simulate the data using the  -->
<!-- Cholesky decomposition (chol and rnorm functions in the base R package).  -->
<!-- In any case, briefly describe the method that you used to simulate your data  -->
<!-- in your paper. -->

<!-- Assess the impact of outliers on least squares estimates of the variogram model  -->
<!-- parameters using a short simulation study. Compare the LS estimates based on  -->
<!-- the empirical variogram with those obtained using the robust variograms proposed  -->
<!-- by Cressie and Hawkins (1980) (see Cressie’s book page 69 and page 75 equations  -->
<!-- 2.4.12 and 2.4.13). -->

<!-- # The empirical semivariogram is created by averaging the squared differences  -->
<!-- # between pairs of points that are approximately the same distance apart.   -->
<!-- # Even a few outliers can heavily influence this average (particularly because  -->
<!-- # you're squaring the difference).  -->
<!-- #  -->
<!-- # Outliers are almost always problematic for kriging, but they're particularly  -->
<!-- # bad when the outliers are scattered randomly throughout the study region  -->
<!-- # (rather than being clustered together).  This is because randomly scattered  -->
<!-- # outliers will affect the empirical semivariances at small distances (because  -->
<!-- # they might be right next to low values), but if the outliers are clustered,  -->
<!-- # the squared difference between two outliers might still be small, allowing for  -->
<!-- # accurate semivariogram estimation at small distances (which is the most  -->
<!-- # important part of the semivariogram because closer neighbors get the highest weights). -->

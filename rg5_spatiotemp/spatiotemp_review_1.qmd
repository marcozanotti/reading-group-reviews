  It is a matter of common experience that ore values often do not follow the 
  normal (or lognormal) distributions assumed for them, but, instead, follow 
  some other heavier-tailed distribution. In study we reviewed the two most 
  popular methods for the variogram estimation, that is the classical and the 
  robust variograms, and a simulation study is performed to assess the impact of 
  outliers on the estimates. It is shown that the use of the robust variogram 
  yields stable estimates when the scale of the contamination increases.

## Introduction

an introductory section describing the main task tackled in the paper (along with relevant bibliographic references) 



## Methods

a methodological section covering methods

<!-- # the squared difference between two outliers might still be small, allowing for  -->

<!-- # important part of the semivariogram because closer neighbors get the highest weights). -->


## Simulation

In order to assess the impact of outliers on the variogram estimation based on 
the classical and the robust approaches, we performed a simulation study. 
Simulating Gaussian Random Fields (GRF) and Contaminated Gaussian Random Fields 
(CGRF) involves different approaches due to the added complexity of contamination. 
GRFs solely need a mean and covariance function. This function dictates the 
smoothness and spatial dependence of the field. Common methods for generating 
GRF include the spectral method (using Fast Fourier Transforms) and the Cholesky 
decomposition. Simulating CGRF, instead, introduces an additional layer of 
complexity. Here, the underlying GRF represents the "true" signal, while the 
contamination acts as an independent noise process. Common approaches involve 
generating the GRF first, then adding a separate noise field with its own 
properties (e.g., mean, variance, spatial dependence). Alternatively, one can 
directly simulate the CGRF by incorporating the contamination into the covariance 
function itself.

We followed @cre:1980, where the departure from Gaussianity is 
obtained simulating a GRF with probability $1 - \epsilon$ and a CGRF with 
probability $\epsilon$.  
$$
\begin{cases}
  N(0, \sigma^2), \;\;\;\;\;\;\; with \; probability \; 1-\epsilon \\
  N(0, k^2 \sigma^2), \;\;\;\; with \; probability \; \epsilon
\end{cases}
$$

where $\epsilon$ is the probability of contamination and $k$ measures the scale 
of the contamination. To practically simulate the underlying GRF, we used the 
grf function of the geoR package in R.  

We simulated 1000 spatial points on a regular grid, with a mean of 0 and a 
covariance function with parameters $\sigma^2 = 1$ and $\phi = 0.25$. The base 
scenario, that is no contamination, is simulated with $\epsilon = 0$.

Then we simulated six different scenarios based on the combinations of 
$epsilon = (0.05, 0.1, 0.2)$ and $kappa = (5, 10)$, to assess the impact of
contamination on the variogram estimation under different circumstances.

Nugget and different levels of spatial correlation are not considered in this 
simulation study but they can be easily added to the simulation process.  



## Results

The variogram estimation is performed using the classical (in black) and the 
robust (in red) approaches. The two methods are compared on the different 
simulated scenarios to assess their robustness to contamination. Moreover, 
given that outliers are almost always problematic for kriging, we also estimated 
a variogram model using the OLS estimator to see how the outliers affect the 
model estimates. The estimation process is performed using the functions variog 
and variofit of the geoR package in R.     

The base scenario, that is no contamination, shows that the two methods provide 
almost identical results.

In the presence of contamination, instead, the two methods provide different
results. If we analyze the results in terms of the outliers' scale ($kappa$), we 
can observe two different behaviours. For small outliers' scale, that is
$kappa = 5$, the two methods provide similar estimations independently of the 
number of outliers ($\epsilon$). However, for large outliers' scale, that is 
$kappa = 10$, the estimates are more different the higher the number of outliers.

As expected, from theoretical considerations, the robust variogram estimates are 
generally smaller than the classical ones. Indeed, the classical approach is 
heavily influenced primarily by the scale of the outliers, while the robust 
approach is less sensitive to the contamination. Moreover, the scale of the 
contamination also strongly affects the estimation of the nugget (which should 
be always 0), but the robust approach is much less sensitive to this issue.

## Conclusion

The theoretical considerations suggest that the robust variogram is less 
sensitive to the presence of outliers. For this reason it should be preferred 
when the data are contaminated. The simulation study confirms this results and 
shows that the robust variogram yields stable estimates when the scale of the
contamination increases. However, if the scale of the contamination is small, 
then the two methods provide similar results.
